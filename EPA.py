    Subgroup discovery is a technique that identifies clusters of data 
    within a dataset that can be defined by an understandable description. 
    Each description is a combination of logical rules, for example: 
    `Property_A > 5, AND, Property_B < 2`. 
    Every subgroup has a description like this, and can be used to identify a set of points 
    within a dataset (by applying the rules to the data). 

    Now, you will be asked to perform a task involving subgroup discovery. 
    You will be shown a list of different subgroups, 
    plus information about the subgroups, 
    and then will be asked to select the subgroup that you think is best for the task. 
    You will be given examples of how to calculate a score to rate 
    the performance of a subgroup. 
    After submitting your choice of three subgroups, 
    you will be given a score for the task. 
    Your score will be recorded as part of this study. 
    Your score will not count towards the grade you receive for any course 
    or study programme. Remember that your responses will be anonymised. 
    
    After performing the task, you will be asked to fill in an online 
    questionnaire about different ways of presenting information about subgroups, 
    where you will share your thoughts on how helpful they are. 
    
    To get started, please enter the pseudonymous code you have been given on your information sheet.

    Below, you will see subgroups used to analyse data about bank loans. 
    The data being analysed is as folows.

    and includes information like the purpose of the loan, the duration of the loan,
    the amount of savings the borrower has, and so on.

    The subgroups all attempt to distinguish loans that have been identified by experts 
    as 'bad' credit risks from loans that have been identified as 'good' risks. 
    You will see subgroups that have been trained on a small subset of training data, 
    and will need to decide which ones you believe will perform well 
    on new data. 
    Please note there is no 'ideal' subgroup that perfectly separates 'bad' loans from 'good' loans. 

    To complete the task, you will choose the subgroup that you think will perform best,
    which will then be applied to a previously-unseen 'test set' of data points. After submitting your choice,
    you will also be shown a score for how well the subgroup performs the task. 
    The score will be the number of 'bad' loans included in the subgroup, multiplied by 3 to 
    reflect the fact that bad loans are more rare, minus the number of 'good' loans included in the subgroup. 
    Therefore, selecting many points with a high precision will give a high score.
