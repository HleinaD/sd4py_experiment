    Subgroup discovery is a technique that identifies clusters of data 
    within a dataset that can be defined by an understandable description. 
    Each description is a combination of logical rules, for example: 
    `Property_A > 5, AND, Property_B < 2`. 
    Every subgroup has a description like this, and can be used to identify a set of points 
    within a dataset (by applying the rules to the data). 

    Now, you will be asked to perform a task involving subgroup discovery. 
    You will be shown a list of different subgroups, 
    plus information about the subgroups, 
    and then will be asked to select the subgroup that you think is best for the task. 
    You will be given examples of how to calculate a score to rate 
    the performance of a subgroup. 
    After submitting your choice of three subgroups, 
    you will be given a score for the task. 
    Your score will be recorded as part of this study. 
    Your score will not count towards the grade you receive for any course 
    or study programme. Remember that your responses will be anonymised. 
    
    After performing the task, you will be asked to fill in an online 
    questionnaire about different ways of presenting information about subgroups, 
    where you will share your thoughts on how helpful they are.

    ## The task

    Below, you will see subgroups used to analyse data from the Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.

    The data being analysed is as folows. 
    Each data point in the dataset represents a single month of data for some country,
    and includes information like the average number of cases per day and the average 
    number of hospital admissions. 
    The subgroups all attempt to distinguish months belonging to the year 2022 (the most recent year) from 
    months belonging to 2020 (when the pandemic first became global). Specifically, the subgroups
    aim to find a description of points that belong to 2022. 
    You will see subgroups that have been trained on a small subset of training data, 
    and will need to decide which ones you believe will perform well 
    on new data. 
    Please note there is no 'ideal' subgroup that perfectly separates months belonging to
    2020 from months belonging to 2022.

    To complete the task, you will choose the subgroup that you think will perform best,
    which will then be applied to  
    a previously-unseen 'test set' of data points. After submitting your choice,
    you will also be shown a score for how well the subgroup performs the task. 
    The score will simply be the number of points (in the test set) identified by the subgroup 
    that belong to the year 2022, minus the number of points from 2020 identified by the subgroup. 
    Therefore, selecting many points with a high precision will give a high score.

        might essentially be different ways of describing the same points in the data. 
        In this case, it might be useful to know that they are closely related.

        If two subgroups select quite different data points, then there might be different reasons they are interesting, 
        and it could be worthwhile to investigate them both separately in greater detail.

        In this visualisation, subgroups are connected to each other by how much they overlap.
        If two subgroups select similar subsets of data,

        ## Focus on a specific subgroup

        The next visualisation makes it possible to examine subgroups that are particularly interesting in more detail. 
        This visualisation compares subgroup members (points selected by the subgroup) to non-members 
        (these non-members are also known as the 'complement') for one specific subgroup. 

        The target variable, the variables used to define the subgroup (selector variables), 
        and additional variables that are most clearly different between members and non-members are shown. 
        These respectively appear in the top-left, top-right and bottom panels of the visualisation. 
        This makes it possible to see additional information about the subgroup, 
        and understand more about the circumstances in which the subgroup occurs. 

        In the top-left, the distribution of values for the target variable is shown. 
        A different set of horizontal boxes is used for the subgroup and the complement. 
        In the remaining panels, the subgroup is also indicated by a solid blue line and the complement by a dashed orange line.
